## bitrise-cli rde session terminate

Terminate a running session but keep it for a later restore

### Synopsis

Terminate a running session but keep it for a later restore.

The VM is stopped and its disk is preserved: the session stays in the list as
"terminated" and can be brought back with 'session restore'. Use this when you
intend to come back to this exact session (e.g. to keep uncommitted work or an
expensive warm state). A terminated session keeps using disk space until it is
deleted.

If you are simply done with the session, use 'session delete' instead — it
works on running sessions directly and frees the disk; no terminate needed.

Terminate is asynchronous: by default the command returns while the session
is still "terminating". Pass --wait to block until the session settles into a
terminal state ("terminated" or "failed"), e.g. before restoring it or when
you want the disk snapshot to be complete before moving on.

```
bitrise-cli rde session terminate SESSION_ID [flags]

### Options

```
  -h, --help                    help for terminate
      --wait                    block until the session settles into a terminal state (terminated/failed) before returning
      --wait-timeout duration   max time to wait when --wait is set (Go duration syntax: 30s, 5m, 1h) (default 10m0s)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --no-color           disable ANSI colors (NO_COLOR env is also honored)
  -o, --output string      output format: human|json (default "human")
  -q, --quiet              suppress non-error diagnostic messages
      --theme string       color theme: auto|dark|light|none (default "auto"; overrides terminal background detection)
      --workspace string   workspace ID (or set BITRISE_WORKSPACE_ID or default_workspace_id; auto-detected if you have exactly one workspace)
```
